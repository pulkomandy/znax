The development was done on the Haiku operating system, but any UNIX-style system should do.

The following tools are needed:
* vasm (z80 oldstyle) and vlink
* GNU Make
* cpcfs from the cpcsdk project (only for the DSK version)
* 2cdt by Kevin thacker (only for the tape version)
* ACE emulator for the "make emu" target (but you can manually run the game in another emulator)
* exoraw from exomizer 2
* png2crtc from cpcsdk
* UNIX-compatible rm (for make clean)
* pdflatex with the memoir class package (for compiling the user manual)

To compile the game:

    cd code
    make

The default target will generate both the DSK and CDT files. The makefile automates everything and
declares all the dependencies (unless I missed some), so changes to the sources will be picked
automatically. This includes changes to the PNG files, which will be automatically converted to SCR,
then crunched. The only exception is the music, which needs to be recompiled to the proper target
address with Arkos Tracker. There is currently no tool available to relocate Arkos Tracker songs.

The target "emu" will run the ACE emulator preset to run the game (with fast drives enabled). This
is convenient to quickly test it during development. "make ../ZNAX.dsk" and "make ../ZNAX.cdt" will
do what you expect. This version of the makefile does not include any rules for sending the files
to a real CPC disk or making snapshots.

To compile the manual:

    cd man
    pdflatex manual.latex

This will generate a PDF file for the user manual.

Note that the git history is included if you're curious how things evolved. Unfortunately I started
using git for this project way later than I should have, so a lot of the history is not present and
the first commit imports an already quite complete version of the game.
